var docMod = document.lastModified; // loads last modified time stamp into docMod variable // DANA'S COMMENT - so this section has been given by Dr.Riedel to help me outline
alert("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates alert box with time stamp. If annoying, comment out this entire line. // DANA'S COMMENT - will keep this in mind when trying to test if it will work
console.log("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates message in javaScript console (found in developers tools) with time stamp. // DANA'S COMMENT - was a little confused about the purpose of this, but remebemered from codeacaemdy the console.log function
